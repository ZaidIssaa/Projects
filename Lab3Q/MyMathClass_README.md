This math class I have made does not contain all the methods found in the original, only the ones that were the most useful to me at the time of programming it.

This class features my versions of:
  Math.pow();
  Math.sin();
  Math.cos();
  Math.toRadian();

I have also implemented my own factorial method to solve "n!" type problems, and a method that converts a capital letter to lowercase.
Implemented the latter as I was challenged by a friend.
